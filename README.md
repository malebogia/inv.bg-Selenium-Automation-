Overview

This project was created as a learning and practice tool to strengthen my skills in Java, Selenium automation, and Page Object Model (POM) architecture. The main goal was to get comfortable with:

Writing reusable Selenium methods

Structuring test automation projects using POM

Practicing assertions, waits, and locators

Training my mind to think in layers and architectures for automation

The project is based on the INV.BG web application for invoice management.

 Note: Development of this project has been paused because I decided to start practicing on local projects using Docker for better hands-on experience with containerized testing environments.

AI-Assisted Learning Workflow

I actively use AI assistance while working on this project, but with a careful, critical approach:

I never just copy-paste solutions

I always ask “why” and ensure I understand the reasoning

I almost always rewrite code manually, letter by letter, to internalize patterns

This approach helps me learn faster, retain knowledge, and write clean, maintainable code

This demonstrates thoughtful automation learning — not just automation execution, but also understanding, evaluating, and improving code.
